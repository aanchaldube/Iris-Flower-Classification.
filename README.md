# Iris-Flower-Classification.
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to achieve high classification accuracy. The model is deployed using FastAPI, allowing real-time predictions.
